Privacy Policy for File Manager App
Effective Date: February 23, 2025

Developer: Helmanis Ervins

We respect your privacy and aim to keep your data safe. This Privacy Policy outlines how the File Manager app, built by Helmanis Ervins, handles information on Android 13+ devices.

Permissions and Their Purpose
Install Apps (Request Install Packages)
Lets you preview and install APKs directly. This saves time, and we don’t touch the APK data beyond that.
Storage Access (Read/Write External Storage)
Needed to browse, move, copy, or delete files. Android 13+ limits this to what you allow, keeping it secure.
Full File Management (Manage All Files)
Gives broader control for organizing or cleaning up files. You’ll opt in for this, ensuring transparency.
Internet Access
Links to cloud services like Google Drive. It’s only for your convenience; we don’t track anything else.
Media Access (Images, Videos, Audio)
Helps view and sort specific file types. Android’s granular rules ensure we only access what’s needed.
Storage Stats
Shows what’s taking up space so you can clear it. You approve this, and it’s just for your benefit.
Data We Handle
What: File details (size, type) for app features; cloud logins stay with third-party providers.
Use: Strictly to make the app work—browsing, previews, cleanup. No sharing unless you use cloud features.
Tracking: None. No personal data or analytics unless you opt into crash reports.
Keeping It Safe
Files stay local unless you upload them.
Encryption (if used) relies on your password, which we don’t store.
No data goes to servers unless you send support logs.
Your Control
Adjust permissions in Android settings.
Skip optional features like cloud without issue.
Uninstall anytime to revoke access.
Updates
This policy may change with new features. Check the app for the latest.
